## Different simulations  
  
- `Unbias_B`,`Unbias_A`: simulations starting either from basin B or A.   
- `only_psi`: simulation biasing along psi only    
- `low_biasfactor`: biasing along both psi a phi but tuning the bias factor parameter for the target well-tempered distribution
- `metadynamics`: standard metadynamics simulation biasing along both psi and phi 
- `multiT`: multi thermal with OPES  
- `Benchmark`: inside **angles** folder there are the results relative to the simulation performed biasing both psi and phi. These results are used to estimate correctly the Free Energy Surface of Alanine Dipeptide  
- `On The Fly`: Application of the iterative method on the Alanine Dipeptide.
