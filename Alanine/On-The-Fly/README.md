# On the Fly Estimation of CVs  
The idea is to obtain cvs on the fly  
  
We cannot use all the cumulative data, because the unbias and bias distribution of the data are different.  
Then we have to estimate the correlation function just from few data obtained by "short" simulations (5 ns)  
  
The first attempt is with TICA, a more controllable way to estimate this cvs
