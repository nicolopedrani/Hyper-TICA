# 1D Model  
  
Single particle moving in a one dimensional potential.  
-   **benchmark**: long simulations and bias along *x* axis. Simulations used to compare the obtained results.  
-   **unbias**: short unbias simulation. Then biased simulations are performed biasing along *TICA eigenfunction* and *Deep-TICA eigenfunctions*. 
-   **test_static**: not yet tested.
